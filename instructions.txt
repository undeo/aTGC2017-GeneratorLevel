'interference.cc' creates root files containing a workspace with the parameters describing the interference between different
    aTGC contributions. These workspaces are needed by the signal estimation code. Inputfiles are TTrees in a 'Input' folder.
    The created root-files have to be copied to the Input folder in the directory of the signal estimation code.

use CMSSW_7_4_6
clone the repository with
    git clone https://github.com/undeo/aTGC2017-GeneratorLevel.git

run with
    root -l 'interference.cc("{channel}","{WV}")'
where {channel} is el or mu and {WV} is WW or WZ.



'read_lhe_WW.cc' and 'read_lhe_WZ.cc' process the generated lhe files and creates the TTrees used for interference.cc.
